# Analysis by using python

This project focuses on analyzing product usage data collected from a network of smart vending machines. Using Python and SQL, I developed a solution to monitor inventory levels and usage trends in real time. By identifying high-demand items and restocking inefficiencies, the model enhanced operational efficiency and contributed to a 40% improvement in data retrieval speed. Visualizations were created in Power BI to help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding stock routing and supply chain optimizations.
